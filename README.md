# Running the Program

The program consists of two classes: 'DuplicatesMain' and 'DuplicatesDetector'. 
The 'DuplicatesMain' class executes the program and processes user inputs, 
while the 'DuplicatesDetector' class is responsible for detecting duplicates in the text.

To run the program, use the 'DuplicatesMain' class. Navigate to target/duplicates_lingohub. 
Provide the text as an argument to the main method of the class. 
Here is an example:
java main/java/DuplicatesMain "Das das ist ein Text"

This command executes the program and outputs the duplicates in the provided text like 
Duplicates: das
